# GoTiny VS Code Extension

The GoTiny VS Code Extension is an example of easy integration with GoTiny through the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-sdk). After installing, GoTiny will be available through the command palette. A link can be entered, which is then sent to the [GoTiny API](https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-api) and immediately returned as a short link in VS Code.

#### Built With

- [GoTiny](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gotiny)

Creating short links with GoTiny is accessible for everyone at [gotiny.cc](https://gotiny.cc) and for developers there's an [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-sdk) which is free and doesn't require authentication.
